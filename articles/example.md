# This Is An Example Title

If you don't include a date tag, we'll use the date that we first detected the article in your repo. Articles published in the future won't be visible until that date.

```ruby
def foo
  puts "this is an example of a fenced code block"
end
```

Mixing code and prose in the same file can be cumbersome. To make it easier, we support the `snippet` tag. These tags allow you to embed code from files stored in your `/snippets` directory.

[snippet: example.rb]

You can also include specific line number ranges from a snippet:

[snippet: example.rb:4,6]

## Subheader

We'll use the first h1 in your file as the article title. If we don't detect an h1, we'll generate a title from the file name. All subsequent headers in the article should start at h2.
